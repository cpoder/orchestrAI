//! Auto-mode loop entry points.
//!
//! Auto-mode chains task completion → merge → CI check → fix-on-red so a
//! plan can run end-to-end without a human clicking Merge. The loop is
//! built up across this plan's phases:
//!   - Phase 1: merge on completion (this module — entry point only).
//!   - Phase 2: gate the next-task spawn on CI.
//!   - Phase 3: fix-on-red with bounded retries.
//!
//! Both completion call sites (standalone `pty_agent::on_agent_exit` and
//! SaaS `runner_ws::AgentStopped`) call [`on_task_agent_completed`] so the
//! merge-and-pause behaviour is identical regardless of where the agent
//! ran. The function is a no-op when the plan is not opted into auto-mode
//! or has self-paused — checking that gate is cheap and keeps the call
//! sites unconditional.
