# Wire protocols

Branchwork speaks three protocols beyond plain HTTP:

1. **Session IPC** — a Unix-domain-socket / Windows-named-pipe channel between
   the server (or the runner) and a per-agent supervisor daemon. Length-prefixed
   `postcard` frames over [`session_protocol::Message`].
2. **Runner WebSocket** — JSON `Envelope`/`WireMessage` frames between the
   hosted server and remote runners, with a SQLite-backed outbox providing
   at-least-once delivery for state-changing events.
3. **Dashboard WebSocket** — server → browser fan-out (the `agent_*`,
   `task_status_changed`, `plan_updated`, `plan_checked` events). This page
   covers the first two; the dashboard event vocabulary is documented inline
   in [server.md](server.md) and [user-guide.md](../user-guide.md).

For the binary split that uses these protocols see
[overview.md](overview.md). For the daemon endpoint see
[session-daemon.md](session-daemon.md). For the runner endpoint see
[runner.md](runner.md).

## 1. Session IPC

**Source:** `server-rs/src/agents/session_protocol.rs`

**Transport:** a single `interprocess` local socket per agent.
On Unix this is a Unix-domain socket at `~/.claude/sessions/<agent-id>.sock`; on
Windows it is a named pipe with the same logical path. The supervisor binds
and listens; the parent (server or runner) connects.

**Framing.** Every frame is:

```
+----------------+-----------------------------+
| 4 bytes BE u32 |   postcard-encoded payload  |
|  payload len   |  (1..=MAX_FRAME_BYTES)      |
+----------------+-----------------------------+
```

`MAX_FRAME_BYTES = 8 MiB` (`session_protocol::MAX_FRAME_BYTES`). Both
[`write_frame`] and [`read_frame`] enforce the cap symmetrically — a peer
that asks for more is dropped with `InvalidData`. There is no application-level
heartbeat in the framing layer itself; the `Ping`/`Pong` messages below ride
inside it.

[`write_frame`]: ../../server-rs/src/agents/session_protocol.rs
[`read_frame`]: ../../server-rs/src/agents/session_protocol.rs

### `Message` variants

| Variant | Direction | When sent |
|---|---|---|
| `Input(Vec<u8>)` | client → supervisor | Bytes typed by a dashboard user (or piped by the runner) that should reach the agent's stdin via the PTY master. Empty payloads are legal. |
| `Output(Vec<u8>)` | supervisor → client | A chunk read from the PTY master (the agent's stdout/stderr). Forwarded to every connected client and appended to `<socket>.log` for post-mortem replay. |
| `Resize { cols, rows }` | client → supervisor | The browser resized its xterm.js view. The supervisor forwards the new window size to the PTY so the agent re-paints. |
| `Kill` | client → supervisor | The dashboard requested termination. The supervisor sends `SIGTERM` to the agent, then `SIGKILL` after the grace period, then exits. |
| `Ping` | either direction | Keepalive probe. Used by the server's heartbeat task to detect a silently dead supervisor (see [session-daemon.md](session-daemon.md) — pidfile presence is the canonical crash signal; missed `Pong` is the 45 s fallback). |
| `Pong` | either direction | Reply to `Ping`. |

`Resize`, `Kill`, `Ping`, `Pong` are all unit-ish — they carry no opaque
payload, only their well-typed fields — so they are safe to add tolerance for
in older peers (see versioning below).

### Lifecycle

1. The parent spawns the supervisor (`branchwork-server session …`); the
   supervisor `bind()`s its socket and starts the agent under a PTY.
2. The parent connects, optionally sends an initial `Resize`, then enters a
   read/write loop.
3. The supervisor multiplexes PTY output as `Output` frames to **every**
   currently connected client. Disconnected clients are reaped silently.
4. On reconnect, the parent re-opens the socket and resumes — there is no
   handshake. Backfill is supplied by the **server-side** SQLite
   `agent_output` table (see [persistence.md](persistence.md) once it lands)
   plus the live broadcast; the on-disk `<socket>.log` is post-mortem only.
5. `Kill`, supervisor crash, or agent exit closes the socket; the parent
   detects EOF and reconciles agent state.

## 2. Runner WebSocket

**Source:** `server-rs/src/saas/runner_protocol.rs`,
`server-rs/src/saas/runner_ws.rs`,
`server-rs/src/saas/outbox.rs`,
`server-rs/src/bin/branchwork_runner.rs`.

**Transport:** a single WebSocket per runner.
Runner dials `wss://<saas>/ws/runner?token=<api_token>`; the server validates
the token against `runner_tokens` (SHA-256 lookup; tokens are 256-bit random
hex, see [runner.md](runner.md) for the storage caveat) and either upgrades
the connection or returns 401.

**Encoding:** every frame is one JSON `Envelope`. The body uses serde's
`#[serde(tag = "type", rename_all = "snake_case")]` tagged-union form, so a
frame on the wire looks like:

```json
{ "seq": 17, "runner_id": "runner-…", "type": "agent_started",
  "agent_id": "…", "plan_name": "…", "task_id": "1.2",
  "driver": "claude", "cwd": "/work" }
```

`Envelope.runner_id` is set on **every** frame so the server can demux without
relying on connection state — this matters during the brief window between a
runner reconnecting and the server learning the id from the first
`RunnerHello`. The server sends frames with `runner_id: "server"`.

### Reliable vs best-effort

`WireMessage::is_best_effort()` is the single source of truth for which frames
ride the outbox:

```
best-effort  = AgentOutput | AgentInput | Ping | Pong
reliable     = everything else
```

- **Best-effort frames** carry `seq: null` (the field is omitted in JSON via
  `skip_serializing_if`). They are written straight to the socket and dropped
  on disconnect. There is no ACK and no replay — by the time the connection
  is back, terminal bytes are stale.
- **Reliable frames** are persisted to the sender's outbox table
  (`runner_outbox` on the runner, `inbox_pending` on the server, both keyed
  by an autoincrement `seq`), then sent. The receiver ACKs after persisting,
  the sender prunes. On reconnect the receiver issues `Resume { last_seen_seq }`
  and the sender replays everything strictly greater than that seq.

Receivers de-duplicate via `outbox::advance_peer_seq` (a per-peer high-water
mark in `seq_tracker`). A duplicate frame is **always** ACKed — even though
its side-effects are skipped — so a sender whose previous ACK was lost still
makes progress on the next attempt.

### `WireMessage` variants

#### Runner → SaaS

| Variant | Reliable? | When sent |
|---|---|---|
| `RunnerHello { hostname, version, drivers }` | yes | First message after the WS upgrade and after every reconnect. The server uses it to update the `runners` row and broadcast the dashboard's Drivers panel. |
| `AgentStarted { agent_id, plan_name, task_id, driver, cwd }` | yes | The runner's session daemon successfully spawned an agent; the server inserts an `agents` row in `mode='remote'` and fans out `agent_started` to dashboards. |
| `AgentOutput { agent_id, data }` | **no** (best-effort) | A chunk of base64-encoded PTY bytes. Forwarded to dashboards as `agent_output`. Loss is acceptable: the SQLite `agent_output` table on the server captures the durable transcript. |
| `AgentStopped { agent_id, status, cost_usd?, stop_reason? }` | yes (with one wart) | Agent process exited or was killed. Server updates the `agents` row, runs org-budget enforcement if `cost_usd` is set, and broadcasts `agent_stopped`. **Wart:** the spawn-failure path sends this reliably; the normal-exit path in `branchwork_runner.rs` currently sends it best-effort (`Envelope::best_effort`). See [runner.md](runner.md). |
| `TaskStatusChanged { plan_name, task_number, status, reason? }` | yes | The agent reported a status change via MCP, or the runner detected one. Server upserts `task_status` with `source='manual'`, optionally appends `task_learnings`, and broadcasts `task_status_changed`. |
| `DriverAuthReport { drivers }` | yes | Driver auth state changed (e.g. user finished an OAuth flow). Re-broadcast as `runner_drivers`. Also implicitly delivered by the `RunnerHello` `drivers` field. |

#### SaaS → Runner

| Variant | Reliable? | When sent |
|---|---|---|
| `StartAgent { agent_id, plan_name, task_id, prompt, cwd, driver, effort?, max_budget_usd? }` | yes | Dashboard user clicked "Start" (or "Continue" / "Retry"). Runner spawns the agent via the same `branchwork-server session` supervisor as self-hosted. |
| `KillAgent { agent_id }` | yes | Dashboard user clicked "Kill". Runner forwards a `Kill` over the session IPC. |
| `ResizeTerminal { agent_id, cols, rows }` | yes | Browser resized its xterm.js view. Runner forwards a `Resize` over the session IPC. **Note:** semantically idempotent — duplicated replays are harmless. |
| `AgentInput { agent_id, data }` | **no** (best-effort) | Keystrokes from the browser (base64). Runner forwards as `Input` over the session IPC. Loss on disconnect matches user expectations: typed characters that never reached the agent are not replayed. |
| `TerminalReplay { agent_id, from_offset }` | yes | A reconnecting browser asked the server for backfill from a byte offset; the runner serves the missing range from its local `<socket>.log`. |

#### Bidirectional

| Variant | Reliable? | When sent |
|---|---|---|
| `Ack { ack_seq }` | best-effort | Acknowledges a single reliable frame after the receiver has persisted it. The sender then marks that outbox row `acked=1`. Always sent on duplicates too, so a lost ACK self-heals. |
| `Ping {}` | best-effort | Heartbeat probe. The runner sends one every ~15 s; the server replies inline. Missed pongs are not directly observable — the WS-level close on read timeout is what triggers reconnect. |
| `Pong {}` | best-effort | Reply to `Ping`. |
| `Resume { last_seen_seq }` | best-effort | Sent immediately after a (re)connect by **both** sides. Tells the peer "replay every reliable frame whose `seq > last_seen_seq`." `last_seen_seq` is read from the local `seq_tracker` row for the peer (or `0` for a fresh runner). |

### `DriverAuthStatus` states

`DriverAuthInfo.status` (carried by `RunnerHello.drivers` and
`DriverAuthReport.drivers`) is itself a tagged union on `"state"`. The
dashboard renders each state with a different affordance.

| State | When sent |
|---|---|
| `not_installed` | The driver's CLI binary is missing from `PATH` on the runner — the dashboard offers an install link instead of a Start button. |
| `unauthenticated { help? }` | The CLI is installed but no credentials are configured. `help` is a one-line hint shown to the user (e.g. "run `claude auth login`"). |
| `oauth { account? }` | OAuth-style auth is in place; `account` is the email or login the dashboard shows next to the driver name. |
| `api_key` | An API key is configured. The dashboard shows a green check; we deliberately don't echo any key fragment. |
| `cloud_provider { provider }` | Auth is delegated to a cloud SDK (e.g. AWS Bedrock); `provider` names the SDK so the dashboard can pick the right icon. |
| `unknown` | Default fallback when the runner can't classify the driver's auth — also used by older runners after a server-side enum addition. |

### Connection establishment, in order

```
runner ─► server : HTTP upgrade /ws/runner?token=…
server validates token; on success completes upgrade and begins reader loop

runner ─► server : RunnerHello       (reliable, seq=1)
runner ─► server : DriverAuthReport  (reliable, seq=2)
runner ─► server : Resume{last_seen_seq=N}   (best-effort, server's last seq runner saw)
server ─► runner : Resume{last_seen_seq=M}   (best-effort, runner's last seq server saw)
…both sides replay outbox entries > M / > N…
…steady-state event flow…
```

`runner_ws.rs` sends its `Resume` and replays `inbox_pending` from inside the
"first message" branch, so the runner's `RunnerHello` doubles as the trigger
for both. The runner mirror is in `branchwork_runner.rs` around the
`send_reliable(hello)` / `send_reliable(auth_report)` block.

## 3. Versioning policy

The protocols are pre-1.0 and not yet under a formal compatibility contract,
but the wire format already gives us enough room to evolve safely if we
follow these rules.

### What's safe

- **Adding a new `WireMessage` variant.** Both sides match exhaustively, but
  the server's match arm has a default `{}` for variants it doesn't expect
  from runners (see the trailing arm in `handle_runner_message`). A new
  variant is silently ignored by an older peer; the new peer must tolerate
  the silence (treat the message as best-effort or fall back to a
  pre-existing variant).
- **Adding an `Option<…>` field** with `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]`.
  Older peers ignore unknown fields by default (`serde_json` is lenient);
  newer peers see `None` from older senders. `AgentStopped.cost_usd`,
  `AgentStopped.stop_reason`, `StartAgent.effort`, `StartAgent.max_budget_usd`
  were all added this way.
- **Adding a new `DriverAuthStatus` state.** Same reasoning — the tagged
  union over `state` admits new tags as long as both sides treat unknown tags
  as `Unknown`/no-op.
- **Adding a new session `Message` variant** at the tail of the enum. `postcard`
  encodes the discriminant as a varint, so appending is binary-stable. An
  older peer that receives a new variant will fail `decode` with `InvalidData`
  — so adders must gate use behind a capability check (see below) until the
  rollout is complete.

### What's not safe

- **Reordering or removing variants** in either enum. `postcard` keys on the
  declaration order for the discriminant; reordering changes wire bytes
  silently. Removal breaks decode for in-flight outbox replays. Always append.
- **Changing a field's type** (e.g. `u16` → `u32`, `String` → `Vec<u8>`).
  Both encodings reject mismatched shapes.
- **Removing or renaming a JSON tag.** `WireMessage` discriminates on
  `"type": "snake_case"`; renaming breaks every older peer mid-flight.
- **Tightening `MAX_FRAME_BYTES` downward.** Existing senders may already be
  emitting frames near the cap.

### Forward/backward compatibility in practice

- **Newer server, older runner.** Server must not depend on runner-side
  fields it added. Reliable messages still flow because the outbox layer is
  field-agnostic. New SaaS→runner variants are gated on the `version` string
  in `RunnerHello` — the dashboard either disables the corresponding UI or
  falls back to a pre-existing variant.
- **Older server, newer runner.** The runner sends best-effort the moment it
  starts; reliable frames it sends with new fields are accepted by the
  older server (unknown fields ignored). The runner must tolerate **not**
  receiving new SaaS→runner messages and must not require any handshake
  beyond `RunnerHello`/`Resume` to make progress.
- **Newer server, older session daemon (or vice versa).** The detached
  daemon is upgraded out of band — when the server is upgraded the running
  daemons keep using the old binary they were spawned from. Compatibility
  is maintained by the rules above (append-only `Message` variants, no
  field-type changes); a fresh daemon is launched on the next agent start.
  See [session-daemon.md](session-daemon.md) for the lifecycle.

The versioning hooks we already have:

- `RunnerHello.version` — server-side capability gating per-runner.
- `Envelope.runner_id` plus the per-peer `seq_tracker` — reconnect across
  upgrades is invisible to consumers.
- `outbox` tables persist across server restarts — an upgrade-restart-replay
  cycle delivers nothing twice and loses nothing reliable.

When we cut 1.0 we will freeze the on-wire shape and add an explicit
`protocol_version: u32` field to `RunnerHello` and to the session-IPC
handshake. Until then, follow the append-only rules above.
