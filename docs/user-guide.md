# User guide

This guide walks the dashboard end to end, organized by what you do —
not by which file it lives in. If you just want to get something
working, start with [quickstart.md](quickstart.md). If you want the
internals, see [architecture/overview.md](architecture/overview.md).

Branchwork ships as one binary (`branchwork-server`) that serves both
the SPA and the HTTP/WebSocket API on `http://localhost:3100`. Every
plan is a YAML file under `~/.claude/plans/`; every task runs on its
own git branch under a per-agent supervisor daemon that survives
server restarts.

## Plans

A **plan** is a YAML file describing an entire piece of work — phases,
tasks, dependencies, and (optionally) a verification block. The plan
lives at `~/.claude/plans/<slug>.yaml` and is the source of truth.
Branchwork never stores plan structure in the database; it parses the
file on every read and writes back when you edit through the UI.

### Where plans appear

The **sidebar** ([screenshots/01-sidebar.png](../screenshots/01-sidebar.png))
groups plans by inferred project, splits each project into **Active**
and **Completed**, and shows progress (`done/total`, percentage,
"last modified" age) for each plan. Completed plans collapse by
default. Use the search box at the top of the sidebar to filter by
title, slug, or project.

### Creating a plan

Click **+ New Plan** in the sidebar. The dialog asks for:

- **Folder** — any directory on the host. Auto-completes from
  recently used folders. If the folder doesn't exist, Branchwork asks
  before creating it. If it isn't a git repo yet, it gets `git init`-ed
  the first time a task spawns an agent.
- **Template** (optional) — pick "From scratch" or a built-in template.
  Templates pre-fill the description with prompts that nudge the
  design agent toward a useful structure.
- **Description** — one or two sentences describing what you want
  built. A design agent reads this and writes the actual plan YAML.

Click **Create Plan**. The design agent spawns, writes the YAML to
`~/.claude/plans/<slug>.yaml`, and the file watcher pushes the new
plan into the sidebar as soon as it lands on disk. (`Cmd+Enter` /
`Ctrl+Enter` submits the form.)

See [screenshots/05-new-plan.png](../screenshots/05-new-plan.png).

### YAML schema

The canonical schema lives at the repo root in
[`plan.yaml`](../plan.yaml). The shape is:

```yaml
title: "My plan"
context: |
  Optional background that every agent sees in its prompt.
project: my-project          # optional; inferred if omitted (see below)
created_at: 2026-04-12T...   # optional; auto-set on first save
verification: |              # optional; markdown shell script for Check Plan
  cargo test --workspace
  pnpm --filter @branchwork/web test

phases:
  - number: 1
    title: "Discovery"
    description: "..."
    tasks:
      - number: "1.1"
        title: "Reproduce the bug"
        description: |
          Investigate `server-rs/src/api/plans.rs` and capture evidence.
        file_paths:                # optional; auto-extracted from description if omitted
          - server-rs/src/api/plans.rs
        acceptance: "Repro doc lands in docs/"
        dependencies: []           # task numbers that must be done first
        produces_commit: false     # optional; defaults to true
```

Field notes:

- **`title`, `phases[].number`, `phases[].title`, tasks[].number`,
  `tasks[].title`** are required. Everything else is optional with
  sensible defaults.
- **`file_paths`** are auto-extracted from `description` (regex over
  backtick-quoted and absolute paths). Provide them explicitly when
  the description is too prose-y for the regex.
- **`dependencies`** lock the **Start** button until the listed tasks
  reach `completed` or `skipped`. The button tooltip lists which
  dependencies are still unmet.
- **`produces_commit`** defaults to `true`. Set it to `false` for
  investigation-only tasks (writing repro docs, design notes, audit
  reports) so the **Merge** button is hidden and you don't get false
  "stale merge" prompts. **Discard** is still available — empty
  branches still need cleanup. See
  [design-produces-commit.md](design-produces-commit.md) for the
  rationale.
- **`verification`** is a free-form markdown block. The plan-level
  Check agent uses it as its source of truth (see
  [check agents](#check-agents)).

The full schema is enforced in [`plan_parser.rs`](../server-rs/src/plan_parser.rs).
Missing fields produce a parse warning in the sidebar (dismissable);
the rest of the plan keeps working.

### Editing a plan

The plan board ([screenshots/02-plan-board.png](../screenshots/02-plan-board.png))
edits in place:

- The plan title at the top of the board is click-to-edit.
- Each phase title is click-to-edit.
- Each task's title, description, acceptance criteria, and file paths
  are click-to-edit on the task card. Multi-line fields (description,
  acceptance) expand into a textarea on focus and save on blur or
  `Cmd+Enter`.

Edits round-trip through `PUT /api/plans/<slug>` which re-serializes
the YAML. Comments survive (serde ignores them), but unknown
top-level keys are dropped. If you've hand-edited the YAML and
something looks off after a UI save, run `git diff ~/.claude/plans/`
and re-add anything that didn't make it.

### Project inference

A plan with no explicit `project:` gets one inferred at parse time:

1. Scan `context` and task `description`s for absolute paths.
2. Match each path against directories under `$HOME`.
3. The most-frequent match wins; ties break in scan order.

Inferred projects let the sidebar group related plans and unlock the
plan-level **Check Plan** button. If inference fails the plan lists
under "Unassigned" and Check Plan is disabled with a tooltip
explaining why. Set `project:` explicitly in the YAML to override.

### Migrating from `.md` plans

Older plans were Markdown files (`## Phase 1` / `### Task 1.1` /
bullet lists). The parser still reads them, but every UI feature
that reserializes a plan (title edits, description edits, status
changes via MCP) writes YAML.

When `~/.claude/plans/` contains any `.md` files, the sidebar shows a
**Convert All to YAML** banner. Per-plan **Convert to YAML** buttons
also appear on each `.md` plan board. Both call
`POST /api/plans/<slug>/convert` (and `/api/plans/convert-all`),
which parses the Markdown, writes a sibling `.yaml`, and removes the
`.md` file. Phase/task structure is preserved; manual prose between
sections is folded into `context:` or `description:` fields as
appropriate.

Convert before hand-editing — round-tripping a `.md` plan through
the UI without converting first will leave you with both formats
on disk and the YAML wins on next reload.

---

## Tasks

A **task** is one work item under a phase. Each task has a status,
optional dependencies, optional file paths, and a one-click **Start**
button that spawns an agent on a dedicated git branch.

### Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Not started. **Start** is available unless dependencies are unmet. |
| `in_progress` | An agent is (or was) working on it. **Continue** resumes; **Retry** restarts. |
| `checking` | A check agent is verifying the task. Set/cleared automatically. |
| `completed` | Done. Counts toward `doneCount` in the sidebar. |
| `skipped` | Intentionally not doing it. Counts toward `doneCount`. |
| `failed` | Agent exited unsuccessfully. **Retry** restarts. |

The status badge on each task card is click-to-cycle and right-click
opens a full menu including **Reset** (admin-only escape hatch when a
task is wedged). Status changes also fire from agents (via MCP
`update_task_status` or hooks) and from check agents (verdict).

### Dependencies

`dependencies: ["1.1", "2.3"]` on a task disables **Start** until both
listed tasks reach `completed` or `skipped`. The disabled button
shows an amber "Dependency blocked" banner inside the card listing
every unmet dependency by number. Cyclic dependencies are not
detected — the parser will accept them and the UI will simply leave
all tasks in the cycle un-startable.

### Auto-status

The file watcher checks each task's `file_paths` whenever the project
tree changes. The heuristic is intentionally narrow:

- 0 paths declared, or **none** of them exist → `pending`.
- **Any** declared path exists → `in_progress`.
- **Auto-status never marks a task `completed`.** That requires an
  agent or a human.

This caps over-eager promotion (see
[repro-navbar-false-completion.md](repro-navbar-false-completion.md)
for the bug this rule fixes). Auto writes also tag rows with
`source = "auto"`; subsequent manual changes flip `source = "manual"`
and auto-status will never overwrite them.

### `produces_commit`

Investigation tasks that only produce documentation (repro notes,
design docs, audit reports) shouldn't trigger the **Merge** banner —
their work lives in `docs/`, not on a task branch. Set
`produces_commit: false` on those tasks. The card hides **Merge**,
keeps **Discard**, and swaps the banner heading to "Review artifacts".
The server's empty-branch merge guard (HTTP 409) is still in place
as defense in depth.

### Resetting a stuck task

`Reset` from the status menu clears the task back to `pending` and
unblocks dependants. It does **not** delete the task branch — use
**Stale Branches** (see [git flow](#git-flow)) for that.

---

## Agents

An **agent** is one CLI session (claude / aider / codex / gemini)
running against one task on its own git branch. Each agent lives
inside a detached supervisor daemon (`branchwork-server session`) so
killing the dashboard server doesn't kill the agent — see
[architecture/overview.md](architecture/overview.md).

### Starting an agent

On a task card:

- **Start** (indigo) — pending tasks. Spawns a new agent on
  `branchwork/<plan>/<task>`.
- **Continue** (amber) — in-progress tasks. Resumes the previous
  session if the driver supports session IDs (Claude does), otherwise
  starts a fresh agent on the same branch.
- **Retry** (red) — failed tasks. Behaves like Continue.
- **Check** — read-only verification agent (see
  [check agents](#check-agents) below).
- **Fix CI** (red, inline with the CI badge) — only when CI failed.
  Spawns an agent on `branchwork/fix/<plan>/<task>/<run-id>` with
  the failure log baked into its prompt.

The **driver selector** dropdown above these buttons appears when
more than one driver is registered. While an agent is running it
stays visible but disabled, so you can see which driver is in flight
without it being changeable.

### Attaching to a running agent

Click any task with a live agent (or any row in the **Agents** view)
to open the **Agent Panel** ([screenshots/03-agent-terminal.png](../screenshots/03-agent-terminal.png))
on the right. The panel header shows status, mode (`pty` vs
`stream-json`), short agent ID, plan, branch, and accumulated cost.

Two tabs:

- **Output** — for `pty` agents, a live xterm.js terminal you can
  type into. For `stream-json` agents (check agents), a structured
  render of the JSON event stream — tool calls as blue `[tool-name]`
  labels, assistant text inline, a footer with duration / turn count
  / cost, and a verdict banner at the top once the agent finishes.
- **Diff** — unified diff against the base commit, file-by-file. The
  footer carries the **Discard** and **Merge** buttons (two-stage
  confirm on Discard).

### Stopping an agent

Three buttons in the panel header:

- **Finish** (emerald) — polite shutdown. For Claude this sends
  `/exit` so the model can flush state cleanly. Use this when the
  agent has produced its commit but is waiting on input.
- **Kill** (red) — `SIGKILL` on the supervisor. The on-disk PTY
  transcript and any committed work survive; uncommitted edits in
  the agent's working tree are lost.
- **Close** (×) — just deselects the panel. Doesn't touch the agent.

### Survival across server restarts

A running agent doesn't depend on `branchwork-server`. Restart the
server and reopen the page; the agent panel reattaches to the same
supervisor daemon and replays the PTY transcript from
`~/.claude/sessions/<agent-id>.log`. This is the property exercised
in step 5 of the [quickstart](quickstart.md).

If the supervisor itself died (host reboot, OOM kill), the server
detects this on startup via `cleanup_and_reattach` and marks the
agent `failed` with `stop_reason = orphaned`, broadcasting
`agent_stopped` so the card unlocks.

### Check agents

Check agents are read-only verification runs that produce a
**verdict** (`completed` / `in_progress` / `pending` plus a reason
string). They never commit. Three entry points:

- **Check** on a task card — verifies one task against its
  description, file paths, and acceptance criteria.
- **Check Phase** (on each phase) — fans out one check agent per
  unfinished task in that phase, in parallel.
- **Check All** (on the plan header) — fans out across the entire
  plan. Asks for confirmation before spawning.
- **Check Plan** (on the plan header) — runs the plan's
  `verification:` block. Disabled when the plan has no
  `verification` or no inferred project. The verdict badge
  (`✓` / `◐` / `✗`) sits inside the button and persists to
  `plan_verdicts` in the DB so it survives reload.

Verdicts also gate the **Merge** banner: a check agent that says
`incomplete — agent did not commit its work` flips the task back to
`in_progress` even if the working tree looked dirty.

### check-agents query

The **Agents** view in the sidebar (with active count badge) shows
the agent tree across all plans. Filter by status (All / Running /
Done / Failed) or by plan. Each row shows status dot, task ID, cost,
plan name, last tool used, and current working directory. Parent
agents (e.g., a design agent that spawned a check agent) nest their
children indented under them.

---

## Drivers

A **driver** wraps one external CLI (`claude`, `aider`, `codex`,
`gemini`) so Branchwork can spawn it, parse its output, and pass it
the right flags. The set of installed drivers and their auth status
shows up in the sidebar as a compact "Driver auth status" panel.

| Driver | Binary | Cost | Verdict | Session resume | MCP auto-inject |
|--------|--------|------|---------|----------------|------------------|
| `claude` | `claude` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `aider`  | `aider`  | — | partial | — | — |
| `codex`  | `codex`  | — | partial | — | — |
| `gemini` | `gemini` | — | partial | — | — |

Capability flags map to UI behaviour: cost columns hide when the
driver doesn't `supports_cost`; verdict UI defers to whatever signal
the driver can parse; session resume turns **Continue** into a true
resume rather than a fresh spawn on the same branch.

### Auth flows

Each driver reports an auth state on startup:

- **`oauth`** — Claude after `claude` login (account email shown).
- **`api_key`** — env-var based (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` etc.).
- **`cloud_provider`** — Codex with an OpenAI org / Gemini with a
  GCP project.
- **`unauthenticated`** — installed but not logged in. Sidebar shows
  a help string telling you what to run.
- **`not_installed`** — binary not on `PATH`. Help string points at
  the install docs.
- **`unknown`** — status check is best-effort; an unknown reading is
  treated as "probably ready" so a driver isn't permanently hidden
  when its CLI changes its `--version` output.

### Picking a driver

Defaults to `claude`. Override per task in the driver dropdown on the
task card (visible whenever more than one driver is registered).
There's no "global default driver" knob — Branchwork picks the first
ready driver in registration order, which is `claude`.

Use Claude when you can — the MCP integration gives the agent
read/write access to the plan, task statuses, blocker reports, and
cost reports while it's running, which closes the loop on a lot of
otherwise-manual coordination.

### Authoring a new driver

`AgentDriver` is a small Rust trait — `binary()`, `spawn_args()`,
`format_prompt()`, `is_ready()`, `parse_cost()`, `parse_verdict()`,
`mcp_config_json()`. Register it in `DriverRegistry::with_defaults`.
A reference page for this lives at
[reference/drivers.md](reference/drivers.md) and the trait
itself is in [`server-rs/src/agents/driver.rs`](../server-rs/src/agents/driver.rs).

---

## Git flow

Every task runs on its own branch. Merge happens in the dashboard.

### Branch naming

- **Task branches**: `branchwork/<plan-slug>/<task-number>` — e.g.,
  `branchwork/architecture-docs/1.2`. Created at agent start, merged
  into the source branch (the branch you were on when the agent
  spawned, usually `main` / `master`) when you click **Merge**.
- **Fix branches**: `branchwork/fix/<plan-slug>/<task-number>/<run-id>`
  — created by the **Fix CI** button, off the failing commit SHA so
  the agent has the same tree the workflow saw.

### Reviewing the diff

The **Diff** tab in the agent panel shows a unified diff per file
with sticky file headers, hunk headers, and per-line +/- coloring.
The "All (N files)" tab concatenates everything; per-file tabs let
you focus on one. The footer carries the merge controls and the base
commit SHA so you know what you're diffing against.

### Merging

The **Merge** button on the task card (and inside the diff footer)
runs `git checkout <source>` then `git merge --no-ff <task-branch>`.
A server-side guard runs `git rev-list --count <source>..<branch>`
first; zero commits returns HTTP 409 with the literal message
`task branch has no commits — agent exited without committing`,
which the card surfaces as an inline error. This is what catches an
agent that exited cleanly without committing — the guard fires
before the checkout so your working tree isn't touched.

If the task is `produces_commit: false` the **Merge** button is
hidden entirely. If a task that should commit ended with no commits,
prefer **Continue** or **Retry** over a manual workaround — the agent
needs to actually do the work.

### Discarding

**Discard** deletes the task branch (`git branch -D`). Two-stage
confirm. Use it for failed attempts you'll redo from scratch, or for
investigation tasks where the artifact landed in `docs/` rather than
on the branch.

### Stale branches

The plan board's **Stale Branches** button opens a modal listing
every `branchwork/<plan>/*` ref it can find, with commit count, age,
and originating agent ID. Branches with zero unique commits ahead of
`main` are pre-checked. A **force** checkbox unlocks the rest. Bulk
deletion happens on the server via `git branch -D`. This is the
recommended cleanup path; manual `git branch -D branchwork/...`
works too but you'll have to figure out which branches are safe.

---

## Cost tracking & budgets

When a driver `supports_cost`, Branchwork sums the cost it reports
into per-agent, per-task, per-plan, and per-org buckets.

- **Per-task cost** shows on the task card (small yellow mono number
  next to the task ID) when greater than zero.
- **Per-plan cost** shows in the plan header alongside `done/total`.
- **Per-org cost** drives the SaaS billing path (see
  [`server-rs/src/saas/billing.rs`](../server-rs/src/saas/billing.rs)).

Plan-level **budgets** are editable inline in the plan header.
Format: `Budget: $X / $Y`. Color-codes at 80% (amber) and 100% (red).
Setting a budget to `0` clears it.

In SaaS mode, organization-level budgets and per-user quotas are
enforced as a **kill switch** — once an org exceeds its monthly cap,
new agent spawns are rejected with `budget_exceeded` until the next
billing period or until an admin raises the cap.

The `BRANCHWORK_WEBHOOK_URL` env can deliver "80% reached" / "100%
reached" notifications (see [notifications](#notifications)).

---

## CI integration

When a task branch merges and the project has `.github/workflows/`
plus a working `gh` CLI, Branchwork pushes the source branch to
`origin` to kick off the workflow, then polls every 30 seconds via
`gh run list` / `gh run view` for up to 30 minutes.

The CI badge on the task card cycles through:

- `pending` → `running` → `success` (green ✓)
- → `failure` (red ✗)
- → `cancelled` (gray) / `unknown` (gray)

Failed and cancelled badges have a small **×** that dismisses the
badge (the CI run record stays in the DB, the UI just stops showing
it).

When CI fails, the **Fix CI** button appears inline with the badge.
It calls `POST /api/actions/fix-ci`, which:

1. Fetches the failure log tail (cached at ~8 KB on first hit).
2. Creates `branchwork/fix/<plan>/<task>/<run-id>` off the failing
   commit SHA — not off `main`, so the agent sees the broken tree.
3. Spawns an agent with the task prompt **plus** the failure log
   **plus** an explicit "run `cargo fmt && cargo clippy && cargo
   test` (or the project equivalent) before committing" instruction.

When the fix agent commits, the task card's merge banner reactivates
on the fix branch.

CI is best-effort: missing `gh`, no `origin` remote, no workflows, or
permission errors all silently degrade — the merge still succeeds,
just without CI tracking.

---

## Auto-mode

Two opt-in toggles on the plan header turn a plan from "click Start,
click Finish, click Merge, click Start on the next task" into a
hands-off pipeline.

- **Auto-advance** — when one task completes, automatically start the
  next ready task in the plan. One agent at a time.
- **Auto-mode** — auto-advance **plus** auto-merge each task on
  completion, wait for CI, and spawn a fix agent on failure (up to
  `max_fix_attempts` times before pausing).

Flip them per plan via the toggles on the plan header (or
`PUT /api/plans/:name/config`).

### The auto-mode pill

When auto-mode is on, the plan header shows a small status pill that
mirrors the loop's state:

- `auto: idle` (green) — armed, no task in flight.
- `auto: merging task N` (amber) — merging the completed task into
  the source branch.
- `auto: waiting on CI` (indigo) — polling `gh run list` for the
  merged commit.
- `auto: fixing CI (attempt N/cap)` (orange) — a fix agent is running
  against the failing run.
- `auto: paused — <reason>` (red) + **Resume** — the loop hit a
  failure it can't recover from (`merge_conflict`,
  `agent_left_uncommitted_work`, `budget_exceeded`, …). Click
  **Resume** to clear the pause and re-evaluate from the last
  completed task. The reason is persisted on the plan config so a
  fresh page load still shows the paused pill.

A third **Parallel** switch sits next to the Auto-advance / Auto-mode
toggles but is currently disabled — see
[Parallel auto-advance](#parallel-auto-advance) for why.

### Parallel auto-advance

Auto-advance is **sequential by default** — one task agent per plan
at a time. Parallel mode would let independent sibling tasks run
concurrently, but it requires worktree-per-agent isolation (each
agent on its own checkout) to avoid interleaved diffs on a shared
working tree. Until that lands, the parallel toggle on the plan
board is disabled and any API attempt to set `parallel=true` is
rejected with `412 worktrees_required`.

---

## Notifications

`--webhook-url <url>` (or the `BRANCHWORK_WEBHOOK_URL` env) accepts a
Slack incoming webhook or any JSON-accepting endpoint. The payload
is `{"text": "..."}` so Slack works out of the box; other endpoints
will see the same shape.

Triggers:

- Agent completion (per task: status, cost, branch).
- Phase advance (when a phase fully completes and the next opens).

Email notifications use SMTP env vars (`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`,
`SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM`) and are reserved for
budget alerts in SaaS mode. The reference page at
[reference/configuration.md](reference/configuration.md) _(stub)_
will enumerate them all.

If neither is set, notifications silently no-op. Webhook calls have a
5-second timeout and errors are logged but never surface in the UI —
they're best-effort by design.

---

## Settings

There is no "settings page" in the app — every setting is either a
CLI flag, an environment variable, or a one-knob control on the
sidebar.

### Sidebar controls

- **Effort selector** (Low / Medium / High / Max) — sent to every
  newly spawned agent and recorded as the user's default. Stored via
  `PUT /api/settings`.
- **Driver auth status** — read-only; expanding a driver shows the
  help text for fixing its auth state.

### CLI flags (`branchwork-server`)

| Flag | Default | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `--port` | `3100` | HTTP/WS listen port. |
| `--effort` | `high` | Default effort for new agents (overridable per task). |
| `--claude-dir` | `~/.claude` | Holds `plans/`, `branchwork.db`, `sessions/`. |
| `--webhook-url` | unset | Slack-compatible webhook for completion / phase events. Also reads `BRANCHWORK_WEBHOOK_URL`. |

Subcommands (`branchwork-server <subcommand>`):

- `session` — internal supervisor daemon, spawned by the server
  itself. Not for end users.
- `mcp` — serve the Branchwork MCP tools over stdio (for Claude Code
  configured to spawn it as a child process). The same MCP handler
  is also mounted at `/mcp` on the HTTP listener.

A full per-flag reference is in
[reference/cli.md](reference/cli.md) _(stub)_; environment variables
in [reference/configuration.md](reference/configuration.md) _(stub)_.

### `~/.claude/` layout

```
~/.claude/
├── plans/                # YAML (and legacy .md) plan files — source of truth
│   └── <slug>.yaml
├── branchwork.db         # SQLite: agents, task_status, cost, audit, outbox
├── sessions/             # one socket + log + pid per agent
│   ├── <agent-id>.sock
│   ├── <agent-id>.log    # PTY transcript, replayed on reattach
│   ├── <agent-id>.pid
│   └── <agent-id>.mcp.json   # auto-injected for Claude agents
└── settings.json         # Claude Code's own settings (Branchwork doesn't write here)
```

Branchwork writes `plans/`, `branchwork.db`, and `sessions/`. It
reads `settings.json` only to confirm Claude Code's hook config (see
the historical Phase 4.1 work on hooks).

---

## Audit log

The **Activity** view in the sidebar (icon: clipboard) opens an
audit log of every state-changing action: agent starts and stops,
task status transitions, branch merges and discards, plan creates
and edits, budget changes, member roles (in SaaS mode).

Filter by action type or resource type. Export to CSV. The table is
paginated (50 per page) and updates live via `audit_log` WS events.
Each row shows the human-readable diff (`pending → completed`,
`branch merged into main`, etc.) so you don't have to dig into IDs
to see what happened.

---

## Authentication

Self-hosted Branchwork runs unauthenticated by default — anyone who
can reach the port has full access. SaaS mode (`branchwork-runner`
plus the hosted dashboard) requires login.

The login page handles email + password sign-up / sign-in plus SSO
discovery: when you type an email whose domain has an SSO provider
configured, the form swaps to "Continue with <IdP>" and SAML / OIDC
takes over. JIT provisioning creates the user on first SSO login.
Errors come back as URL params (`?sso_error=...`) and render with
humanized text on the login page.

Cookies are HttpOnly + SameSite=Lax. Sessions rotate on login. Org /
member / SSO / runner-token endpoints all live under `/api/orgs/...`
— see the operations docs for runner token issuance and SSO
configuration.
